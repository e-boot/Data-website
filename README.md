# SPA - Final Assignment Project

## Project Overview 🚀

This project involves creating a themed single-page application (SPA) inspired by the Star Trek character, Data. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and consumes data from the Star Trek API (STAPI). It provides users with comprehensive information about Data, including episodes, appearances, and character details, while offering an engaging and interactive experience. The project is a collaborative effort aimed at enhancing skills in full-stack development, REST API integration, and modern web development practices.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **HTML5**: For structuring and organizing the content of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling the web pages and ensuring responsive design across devices.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and dynamically displaying data retrieved from APIs.
- **STAPI**: The primary API used for retrieving detailed information about Data from the Star Trek universe.

## API Used

- **STAPI (Star Trek API)**: [STAPI Documentation](http://stapi.co) - This API provides detailed information on characters, episodes, starships, and more from the Star Trek universe. It's the core data source for this project, enabling us to fetch and display relevant details about the character Data.
